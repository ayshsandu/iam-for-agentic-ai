# Guiding Principles for Agentic AI IAM

While standards and protocols provide the technical foundation, guiding principles help us make sound design decisions when building IAM systems for agentic AI. These principles are especially important when standards don't yet exist or need to be adapted for novel scenarios.

## Core Principles

*   [**Security Architecture**](./security-architecture.md) - Designing Secure Agentic AI Systems
*   [**Zero Trust for Agents**](./zero-trust.md) - Assume no implicit trust; continuously verify every agent and action
*   [**Agent Lifecycle Management**](./lifecycle.md) - Govern agent creation, updates, decommissioning, and monitoring
*   [**Least Privilege for Agents**](./least-privilege-for-agents.md) - Grant agents only the minimum permissions necessary
*   [**Transparency & Auditability**](./transparency-auditability.md) - Make agent actions visible and traceable
*   [**User Control & Consent**](./user-control-consent.md) - Keep humans in the loop for authorization decisions
*   [**Defense in Depth**](./defense-in-depth.md) - Layer multiple security controls
*   [**Fail Securely**](./fail-securely.md) - Default to secure states when things go wrong
*   [**Identity Verification**](./identity-verification.md) - Establish strong agent identity assurance
*   [**Dynamic Access Control**](./dynamic-access-control.md) - Adapt permissions based on context and risk
*   [**Privacy by Design**](./privacy-by-design.md) - Protect user data throughout the agent lifecycle

## Applying These Principles

These principles work together to create a comprehensive security posture. For example:
- **Least Privilege** limits the scope of potential damage
- **Transparency** enables detection of violations
- **User Control** maintains human oversight
- **Defense in Depth** provides multiple layers of protection

When designing your agentic AI systems, consider how each principle applies to your specific use case and how they can work together to create a robust, trustworthy system.
