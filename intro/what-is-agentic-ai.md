# What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Think of them not just as tools that respond to direct commands, but as entities that can operate with a degree of autonomy.

**Key Characteristics:**
*   **Autonomy:** Can operate independently without constant human intervention.
*   **Goal-Oriented:** Designed to achieve specific objectives.
*   **Proactive:** Can initiate actions, not just react.
*   **Interactive:** Can communicate with users, other systems, and other agents.

Examples range from simple chatbots that book appointments to complex systems managing financial portfolios or controlling robotic processes. As they take on more significant tasks, ensuring they are who they say they are and only do what they're allowed to do becomes paramount. This is where IAM comes in.
