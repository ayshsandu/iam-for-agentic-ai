# Why IAM Matters for Agents

As agentic AI systems become more capable and autonomous, the stakes of getting Identity and Access Management right become significantly higher.

**The Risks:**
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** Agents might access resources or perform actions they shouldn't be allowed to.
*   **Data Breaches:** Compromised agents could expose sensitive information.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Agents might gain more permissions than intended.
*   **Accountability Gaps:** Without proper IAM, it becomes impossible to track who did what.
*   **Trust Erosion:** Users and organizations lose confidence in agentic systems.

**Why Traditional IAM Falls Short:**
*   Traditional IAM is designed for human users with manual workflows.
*   Agents operate at machine speed and scale.
*   Agents may need to act on behalf of multiple users.
*   Agent capabilities can evolve dynamically.

Getting IAM right from the beginning is crucial for building trustworthy, secure, and scalable agentic AI systems.
