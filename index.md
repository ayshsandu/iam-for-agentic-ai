# Welcome to Agentic AI IAM Hub

**Understanding Identity and Access Management for Intelligent Agents**

Agentic AI systems – AI that can take actions, make decisions, and operate autonomously – are rapidly evolving. As these agents become more capable and integrated into our digital lives and business processes, how we manage their **Identity** (who or what they are) and their **Access** (what they are allowed to do) becomes critically important.

This site aims to:
*   Highlight common **IAM problems** you'll encounter when building or using agentic AI.
*   Show how **existing standards** like OAuth 2.0 can be adapted to solve many of these.
*   Provide **guiding principles** for designing secure and trustworthy agentic systems, especially where standards are still emerging.

Whether you're a developer building the next generation of AI agents, a security professional, or just curious about the implications of this technology, this resource is for you.
